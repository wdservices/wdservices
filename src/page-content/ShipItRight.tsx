  {
    q: 'What is the best book on vibe coding production readiness?',
    a: 'Ship It Right is written specifically for people who built apps using AI tools like Cursor, Bolt, Lovable, and Replit. It covers the exact gaps — security, performance, SEO, legal, and payments — that these tools don\'t handle automatically.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What should I check before launching a vibe-coded app?',
    a: 'At minimum: HTTPS and password security, page speed, basic SEO setup, a Privacy Policy, and payment testing if you take money. Ship It Right gives you a full checklist covering all of this and more.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I make my Bolt, Cursor, or Lovable app secure?',
    a: 'Start with password hashing, environment variables for API keys, and server-side permission checks. Chapter 1 of Ship It Right walks through each of these in plain English.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens when my vibe-coded app gets 1,000 users?',
    a: 'Without preparation, databases slow down, servers get overwhelmed, and email delivery can fail. Chapter 3 covers exactly what breaks at different user counts and how to prevent it.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need a Privacy Policy for an app built with AI tools?',
    a: 'Yes — if your app collects any personal data (which almost all apps do), you\'re legally required to have one in most countries. Chapter 6 covers this and other legal essentials.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is this book for non-technical founders?',
    a: 'Yes. Every chapter is written in plain language with no coding jargon, plus screenshots and step-by-step instructions. If you can use ChatGPT, you can follow this book.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Where can I buy Ship It Right?',
    a: 'Available on Amazon (Kindle and paperback), Gumroad, and Selar. See the Buy Now section above for direct links.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can a vibe-coded app handle real users, or is it just for demos?',
    a: 'This is one of the most searched anxieties. The gap between a working demo and a production-grade application is where most vibe-coded projects quietly fail — not with a dramatic crash, but with slow page loads that drive users away, unhandled errors that silently eat data, and security holes that invite exploitation. Ship It Right gives you the exact checklist to close that gap before you go live.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What are the most common security mistakes in vibe-coded apps?',
    a: 'The primary risks include hardcoded secrets like API keys in the repository, severe injection vulnerabilities such as SQL/XSS, insecure data storage, and compliance violations due to improper data handling. Ship It Right walks you through how to catch and fix each of these before a single user touches your app.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does my vibe-coded app need to be GDPR or HIPAA compliant?',
    a: 'Most consumer vibe coding tools run on US-based shared cloud. If your app handles EU citizen data, you may be in GDPR violation the moment the AI deploys it. If you\'re handling healthcare data under HIPAA, financial data under SOX, or personal data under GDPR, you can\'t deploy software that lacks proper access controls, audit trails, and data handling policies — and vibe-coded applications generated without these requirements in mind don\'t become compliant through iteration. They require fundamental architectural changes. The book covers exactly what to do before you hit that wall.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Will my vibe-coded app break when it scales?',
    a: 'At 50 users, no monitoring, no alerting, and no structured logging is fine. At 5,000, it\'s a liability. At 50,000, it\'s an incident. The AI cannot anticipate scale requirements — an app might work fine during testing with 50 records but would not hold up with 10,000+ users in production. Ship It Right shows you how to build for the scale you\'re aiming for, not just the demo you built.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I maintain or update my vibe-coded app after launch?',
    a: 'Making a change to one part breaks something in another. The AI doesn\'t know the history — you ask it to add a feature and it introduces a regression elsewhere. Code generated today needs to be understood, modified, and debugged by engineers next month or next year. AI-generated code often lacks comments, uses unfamiliar patterns, or implements logic in ways that aren\'t idiomatic for your team\'s stack. The book addresses how to structure your app so it stays maintainable as it grows.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I add SEO to an app built with Lovable or Bolt?',
    a: 'Most AI coding tools generate apps with zero SEO setup — no meta tags, no structured data, no sitemap, no Open Graph tags. Search engines can\'t see your app, and when people share it on social media, there\'s no preview. Chapter 4 of Ship It Right walks you through exactly what to add: meta titles and descriptions, Open Graph and Twitter Card tags, XML sitemaps, robots.txt, canonical URLs, and structured data — all without needing to understand code.',
